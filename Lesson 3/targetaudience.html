    <h2>Travelers</h2>
    <p>
      This target audience will want to know the current weather conditions
      especially on the specific town or place they are traveling. Some senarios
      that come to mind are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the weather is nice are there any activites to do in this
        specifictown?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there a storm warning that will disrupt any local acvities based
        onthat town?
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is a blizzard or heavy snowfall is there any precautions
        thatneed to be taken?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I can see travelers useing this mostly on their phone to quickly see what
      how the weather is while traveling. I can see it being a mom or a dad
      traveling with their family, or a couple taking a romantic trip, or a
      group of college kids planning a trip on the weekend or during a week break.

    <h2>Locals</h2>
    <p>
      This target is similar to the travelers but they aren't worried too much
      about the weather from other towns. The senarios come into to mind are the
      following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How's the weather going to be in my town or county?</li>
      <li>Is the weather nice enough to do any outdoor activites?</li>
      <li>If it's snowing bad are the schools closed in my county?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I feel that majority of this audience are parents or people who are older
      than 30 and like the previous group, this website needs to be user
      friendly.
